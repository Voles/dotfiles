Dotfiles
========

> Technically speaking, in computing a "dot file" is a hidden directory or file on a UNIX/Linux system that are so named because they are prefixed with a full stop. Dot files within a user's home directory contain most of the user-specific configuration available on a desktop and are configured manually or through the use of tools.

# TODO: use symlinks, The symlinking rather than mere copying is so that I can just pull down updates and have them work without me having to install anything again.
